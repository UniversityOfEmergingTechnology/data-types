# Flutter Data Types and Variable Declaration

## Constants in Dart

In Dart, constants are declared using the `final` or `const` keywords.

- `final`: Used to declare a variable whose value cannot change after it is initialized.
- `const`: Used to declare compile-time constants.

## Data Type Basics

Dart is a statically typed language, meaning variables must have a declared data type.

## List

A List in Dart is an ordered collection of elements.

## Map

A Map in Dart is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

## Set

A Set in Dart is an unordered collection of unique elements.

## Variable Declaration

Variables in Dart are declared using the `var`, `dynamic`, or explicitly mentioning the data type.

- `var`: Dart infers the data type based on the assigned value.
- `dynamic`: Represents a variable whose type can change during runtime.
- Explicit declaration: Specify the data type explicitly.

This README provides a basic understanding of data types and variable declaration in Dart for Flutter development.
